# Wallet (embedded EVM) — developer docs

Parent index: **[`docs/README.md`](../README.md)** (Nostr, MLS, storage layout, build).

These files are **tracked in git** and are intended for references from **source comments** and **user-facing strings** (e.g. error hints). Paths are stable on GitHub.

**Maintainers — alpha-only migrations (remove before beta / public v1):** WalletBar token-dropdown → watched-token list — [`docs/legacy-fixes/LF-002-wallet-bar-token-filter-migration.md`](../legacy-fixes/LF-002-wallet-bar-token-filter-migration.md). EVM address repair — [`docs/legacy-fixes/LF-001-evm-address-repair.md`](../legacy-fixes/LF-001-evm-address-repair.md). Full catalog: [`docs/legacy-fixes/CATALOG.md`](../legacy-fixes/CATALOG.md).

Supplementary planning notes live under **`ai-docs/`** (e.g. settings refactor backlog); **`docs/wallet/`** here is the canonical index for implementation-linked behavior.

**Dev:** With `vite` dev mode, the wallet sidebar shows **Post test announcement (dev)** — sends a valid `wallet_tx_announcement` JSON with a fake hash so `WalletTxAnnouncementCard` can be checked in-thread before real sends.

**Desktop (Tauri):** `get_wallet_summary` and `wallet_build_and_send_transaction` are registered commands; TypeScript helpers live in `src/lib/wallet/backend-wallet.ts`. Sends default to **broadcast-only** (`waitForConfirmation: false`); receipt polling is background via `wallet_wait_for_transaction` and `src/lib/evm/on-chain-background.ts` — see [TRANSACTION_LIFECYCLE.md](./TRANSACTION_LIFECYCLE.md). **DM WalletBar Send** resolves the peer **`0x`** as **`dm_peer_evm`** first, then **`profiles.evm_address`** (see `docs/legacy-fixes/LF-003-peer-evm-send-fallback.md`). **Pairwise** **`wallet_peer_info_*`** DMs populate **`dm_peer_evm`**. A raw **`0x`** recipient from Settings passes **`to_address_evm`** so the backend skips npub resolution. After broadcast from a **DM** send, the client appends an optimistic **`wallet_tx_announcement`** card, then relays the confirmed payload when the receipt succeeds (`finalizeWalletDmTransferAfterBroadcast` in `wallet-dm-transfer.ts`). **Request** in the wallet bar posts **`wallet_tx_request`** JSON via `formatWalletTxRequest`. Those DM payloads **require** **`from_evm_address`** (active signer). **Kind 0** profile metadata may carry a **default-shared** payout `evm_address` for visibility; it can differ from the **active** signing address in **Settings → Default wallet config**.

Accepting a request opens the send form pre-filled and may attach **`request_id`** on the announcement when present.

**Balance cache:** The last successful **`get_wallet_summary`** response is stored per account as **`pacto_wallet_summary_cache_v1_<npub>`** (includes a fingerprint of the watched-token list). It is read into memory in **`loadAccountState`** (`src/stores/persistence.ts`) and shown immediately when the WalletBar refreshes if the list still matches; see **`src/lib/wallet/wallet-summary-cache.ts`**. Cleared with other npub-scoped keys on logout (`clearAccountState`).

### Squad vs Advanced keys

- **Squad accounts** (`purpose: squad`): DM WalletBar Send, squad roster shares, treasury deploy, and governance commands. Only squad-purpose keys may be the active signer or profile receiving address.
- **Advanced accounts** (`purpose: advanced`): imported keys or derived advanced-only addresses. Used only from **Settings → Advanced** contract call (`WalletAdvancedPanel.svelte`). Backend command **`evm_send_advanced_contract_call`** refuses squad signers; squad paths refuse advanced addresses (Phase G).
- **Generic reads** (token/module observation): viem via **`src/lib/evm/read-plane.ts`** — no private key. Does not replace curated pacto-gov dashboard reads in Rust.
- **Squad allowlisted calls:** Dashboard → Settings → **Smart contract security** — squad keys may call explicit allowlist targets + implicit deploy infra only (`evm_send_squad_allowlisted_contract_call`).
- Operator smoke: [OPERATOR_SMOKE.md](./OPERATOR_SMOKE.md).
